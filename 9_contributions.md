Contributions
=============

The Cerberus Protocol is currently under development and we'll be releasing new sections periodically. We're hoping that releasing the protocol in this way will help generate some interest and give us time to gather feedback from bitcoiners who can suggest improvements or spot potential problems that we may have overlooked. When it comes to bitcoin security, there's nothing better than peer review!

To provide feedback, let us know in one of the following ways:

### Email
Send us your comments and suggestions to [storage@clavestone.io](mailto:storage@clavestone.io)

### GitHub
The Cerberus documentation is available on the [Clavestone GitHub repo](https://github.com/Clavestone/Cerberus). If there's anything you'd like to see changed you can:
- **Submit an issue:** Head to the [Issues tab](https://github.com/Clavestone/Cerberus/issues) and provide us: 1) the section and heading your issue relates to, and 2) details of your issue.
- **Edit directly:** If you have specific changes you think would benefit users of the protocol, you can make a pull request directly and we'll get to reviewing it as soon as we can.

Future chapters of the protocol will be published here on a regular basis and will be announced on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/clavestone_) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@clavestone).

## The Team
The Cerberus Protocol is currently developed and maintained by the [Clavestone](//clavestone.io) team:
- Robbert Gorris
- Guillaume Verbal
- Neil Woodfine

## Credits
We'd like the thank the following people that have made contributions to the Cerberus Protocol.
- Nicolas Bahmanyar (*protocol development*)
- Richard Bensberg (*review*)
- [waixin](https://github.com/walxin) (*site setup and styling*)

*Please note that contributions do not necessarily indicate endorsement.*

Also, the Cerberus Protocol emerged from our team's learnings over the course of development of Clavestone, a project to build a commercial platform for corporate multisig storage. We received invaluable feedback from many friends in the industry during development that indirectly made its way into the Cerberus Protocol. **Here's a big thanks to those that helped, you know who you are!**
